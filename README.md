This is my submission for Module 4 challenge. All code included is original and based on code presented in class as well as additional information on the groupby function at https://www.w3schools.com/python/pandas/ref_df_groupby.asp

#Analysis

Looking at the overall data across all schools, I found the most striking information is that students perform much better in reading than in mathematics with a nearly 86% passing rate versus math's ~75%

When comparing the five highest-performing schools to the five lowest, an interesting trend emerges. We see that the higher performing schools all spend less per student, tend to have smaller school bodies, and most notable are all charter while the lower performing schools are all larger district schools.
Indeed, these observations are backed by the school size summary, school budget summary, and the school type summary below.

This correlation bares further analysis of why these different outcomes are so significant. I would be interested in investigating the average household incomes of the student bodies as charter schools tend to attract more affluent students and can self-select their students versus public district schools which must accept everyone.
Another interesting comparison would be comparing these results to those of a similar school district without charter schools available to see if the interschool differences are so stark.
